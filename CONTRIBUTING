Getting started
===============

Before contributing to `juju-core` please read the following sections describing
the tools and conventions of this project. This file is a companion to README
and it is assumed that file has been read prior.

Test

git
---

Juju uses git for source control, and is hosted on github. It also has dependencies
hosted elsewhere with other version control tools. To get started, install git and
configure your username:

$ cat ~/.gitconfig
[user]
        name = A. Hacker
	email = a.hacker@example.com

Sign up for github (a free account is fine):

<https://github.com/join>

Add your ssh public key to your account:

<https://github.com/settings/ssh>

Fork
====

To get your own copy of the source code, hit the "Fork" button on the web page for
the juju core branch:

<https://github.com/juju/core>

Then clone it locally, making sure the repo goes into the correct place in GOPATH,
replace USERNAME with your github user name:

$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/juju
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/juju
$ git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/core.git
$ cd core
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/juju/core.git
$ git fetch upstream

More detailed instructions for the general process are on the github site:

<https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo>

To make sure that any changes you commit pass a basic sanity check, make sure to
add the check script as a git hook:

$ ln -s ../../check .git/hooks/pre-push

Using pre-push requires git 1.8.2 or later, alternatively running the check as a
pre-commit hook also works.

Working
=======

All development should be done on feature branches based on a current copy of master.
When starting a new line of work, first check the branch is on master:

$ git branch
* master
  old_feature

Pull in the latest changes from upstream, assuming you've done the setup as above:

$ git pull upstream master

Make a new branch for your work:

$ git checkout -b new_feature


Imports
-------

Import statements are grouped into 3 sections: standard library, 3rd party
libraries, juju-core imports. The tool "go fmt" can be used to ensure each
group is alphabetically sorted. eg:

    import (
        "fmt"
        "time"

        "labix.org/v2/mgo"
        gc "launchpad.net/gocheck"
        "github.com/juju/loggo"

        "github.com/juju/core/state"
        "github.com/juju/core/worker"
    )

Because "launchpad.net/gocheck" will be referenced frequently in test suites,
its name gets a default short name of just "gc".


Testing
=======

`juju-core` uses the `gocheck` testing framework. `gocheck` is automatically
installed as a dependency of `juju-core`. You can read more about `gocheck`
at http://go.pkgdoc.org/pkg/launchpad.net/gocheck. `gocheck` is integrated
into the source of each package so the standard `go test` command is used
to run `gocheck` tests. For example

    go test github.com/juju/core/...

will run all the tests in the `juju-core` project. By default `gocheck` prints
only minimal output, and as `gocheck` is hooked into the testing framework via
a single `go test` test per package, the usual `go test -v` flags are less
useful. As a replacement the following commands produce more output from
`gocheck`.

    go test -gocheck.v

is similar to `go test -v` and outputs the name of each test as it is run as
well as any logging statements. It is important to note that these statements
are buffered until the test completes.

    go test -gocheck.vv

extends the previous example by outputting any logging data immediately, rather
than waiting for the test to complete. By default `gocheck` will run all tests
in a package, selected tests can by run by passing `-gocheck.f`

    go test -gocheck.f '$REGEX'

to match a subset of test names.

Finally, because by default `go test` runs the tests in the current package, and
is not recursive, the following commands are equal, and will produce no output.

    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/juju/core
    go test

    go test github.com/juju/core

MongoDB
-------

Many tests use a standalone instance of mongod as part of their setup. The
`mongod` binary found in $PATH is executed by these suites.

Some tests (particularly those under ./store/...) assume a MongoDB instance
that supports Javascript for map-reduce functions. These functions are not
supported by juju-mongodb and the associated tests will fail unless disabled
with an environment variable:

    JUJU_NOTEST_MONGOJS=1 go test github.com/juju/core/...

Proposing
=========

When ready for feedback, push your feature branch to github, optionally after
collapsing multiple commits into discrete changes:

$ git rebase -i --autosquash master
$ git push origin new_feature

Go to the web page and hit the "Pull Request" button, selecting master as the target.

<https://github.com/USERNAME/core>

This creates a numbered pull request on the github site, where members of the juju
project can see and comment on the changes.

Make sure to add a clear description of why and what has been changed, and include
the launchpad bug number if one exists.

Its often helpful to mention newly created proposals in the #juju-dev IRC channel on
Freenode, especially if you'd like a specific developer to be aware of the proposal.

Code review
===========

A branch needs at least one approval review in order to land. By convention, this is
signaled by LGTM in a review comment. In the rare case where a propsal has an issue
that means it should not land, NOT LGTM can be used as a veto. Often several rounds
of suggestions are made without either marker, and LGTM is added when the comments
are addressed.

After a proposal has recieved an LGTM, the landing must be notified to test and merge
the code into master. This is done by a member of the juju project adding the magic
string $$merge$$ in a comment.

Dependency management
=====================

In the top-level directory, there is a file, dependencies.tsv, that
holds the revision ids of all the external projects that juju-core
depends on. The tab-separated columns in the file are
the project name, the type version control system used by
that project, and the revision id and number respectively.

This file is generated by running the godeps command (which you
can get with `go get launchpad.net/godeps') on a juju-core
installation with all freshly downloaded directories.

The bash commands used to generate it from scratch are as follows:

    % export GOPATH=/tmp/juju-build
    % go get github.com/juju/core/...
    % go test github.com/juju/core/...
    % godeps -t $(go list github.com/juju/core/...) > dependencies.tsv
