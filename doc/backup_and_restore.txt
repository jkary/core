Backup and restore
==================

Currently backup and restore is run by very different pieces of software.
This doc is intended as an overview of both since, at least in the current
status, changes in juju are prone to break both.

Backup
------

juju-backup is a bash script that runs remote actions on the state-server
and fetches the result in the form of a tgz file named after the date.
The process gathers varios files relevant to the server such as:
* /var/log/juju
* /var/lib/juju
* ~/.ssh/
Also it creates a dump of the mongo db, for this it stops the db, which makes
it less than ideal to be run as often as a backup process should be.

Restore
-------

juju-restore is a go cmd plugin that, if no state-server is present, will
bootstrap a new node is safe mode then upload to the tgz backup file
and:
* Stop juju-db
* Stop jujud-machine
* Loads the backed up db in place of the recently created one
* Untars the fs files ino the current machine
* Runs a set of bash scripts that replace the dns/instance names of the old
machine with the ones of the new one in the relevant config files and also
on the db, if thi step is not preformed peergrouper will kick our machine
out of the vote list and fill it with the old dead ones.
* Restarts all services.

HA
--
HA is a work in progress, for the moment we have a basic support which is an
extension of the regular backup functionality.
Read carefully before attempting backup/restore on an HA environment.

In the case of HA, the backup process will backup files/db for machine 0,
support for "any working state server" is plans for the near future.
We asume, for now, that if you are running restore is because you have
lost all state-server machines. Out of this restore you will get one
functioning state-server that you can use to start you other state machines.
BEWARE, only run restore in the case where you no longer have working
State Servers since otherwise this will take them out of line and possibly
cripple your environment
